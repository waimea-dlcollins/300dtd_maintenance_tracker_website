# Sprint 1 - A Working UI Prototype


## Sprint Goals

Develop a prototype that simulates the key functionality of the system, then test and refine it so that it can serve as the model for the next phase of development in Sprint 2.

[Figma](https://www.figma.com/design/3xvhbf0oNIssvHvngZwedf/300dtd-demo-to-do-list?node-id=0-1&p=f&t=gwqM7lWv4cwaPTXF-0) is used to develop the prototype.

## Initial Database Design
4 tables users, vehicles, user_vehicles, and info. all four of them are used to store infomation mainly about what vehicles users own, what has been done serivce wise to the vehicles and keeping the data of the users that have an account for a swift re login when re visitng the website agian.

### Required Data Input

Replace this text with a description of what data will be input, and where / how it will be obtained.

### Required Data Output

Replace this text with a description of the outputs for the system - what types of data will be displayed?

### Required Data Processing

Replace this text with a description of how the data will be processed to achieve the desired output(s) - any processes / formulae?

## UI 'Flow'

The first stage of prototyping was to explore how the UI might 'flow' between states, based on the required functionality.

This Figma demo shows the initial design for the UI 'flow':

### Testing

Replace this text with notes about what you did to test the UI flow and the outcome of the testing.

### Changes / Improvements

Replace this text with notes any improvements you made as a result of the testing.

## Initial UI Prototype

The next stage of prototyping was to develop the layout for each screen of the UI.

This Figma demo shows the initial layout design for the UI:

### Testing

Replace this text with notes about what you did to test the UI flow and the outcome of the testing.

### Changes / Improvements

Replace this text with notes any improvements you made as a result of the testing.

## Refined UI Prototype

Having established the layout of the UI screens, the prototype was refined visually, in terms of colour, fonts, etc.

This Figma demo shows the UI with refinements applied:

### Testing

Replace this text with notes about what you did to test the UI flow and the outcome of the testing.

### Changes / Improvements

Replace this text with notes any improvements you made as a result of the testing.

## Sprint Review

Replace this text with a statement about how the sprint has moved the project forward - key success point, any things that didn't go so well, etc.
