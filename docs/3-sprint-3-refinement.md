## light and dark mode

when i was testing the website for core functions that make the website useable and appeling to the user i though about the addition of a dark mode, this would allow the user to switch between dark and light mode whenever they want. this would improve the user experience but allowing the user to change the brightness of the website via light and dark mode

### Changes / Improvements
the screenshots above was the icon being inplemeted but it wouldnt allow me to change through the dark and light mode i would have to reload the website, now with the improvements and changes i have made it now allows the user to change between light and dark mode without having to reload the wesbite, which allows for a overall better user experience.

## emojis for different titles
when my end users were giving me feedback on what could improve the user experience of the website they said that i could add emojis around some of the titles of the website i currently have, for example the vehicle description and log descriptions.

### Changes / Improvements

I added some more across more of the pages to further inprove the ability of the user scanning throughout the website to identify areas throughout the website where it could be harder made easier with the addition of these emojis.
