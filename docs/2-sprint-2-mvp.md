# Sprint 2 - A Minimum Viable Product (MVP)


## Sprint Goals

Develop a bare-bones, working web application that provides the key functionality of the system, then test and refine it so that it can serve as the basis for the final phase of development in Sprint 3.

## Sprint Review
this spirnt has helped signficnatly with the development of my website as i have been able to create the main features of the website that need to be made to make it usable for users. some of the key success points of this sprint would be getting the deletion of vehicles and logs working. this part took the longest for me becuase i was having issues with getting the log id and vehicle id, eventually i figuired it out and this feature of deletion made the website alot better. after this success i also added some more data such as engine, transmission, duration, catergory and a few more. some things that didnt go well was probably the time it took to get the deletion of vehicles and logs working. it took a lot longer than it needed to and i could of used that time more effectively and improving my website further.
